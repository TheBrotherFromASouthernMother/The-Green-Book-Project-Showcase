### The Green Book Project Showcase
The Green Book Project was a user driven mobile application that helped women, queer folks, people of color, and folks with disabilities find inclusive and accomodating establishments whenever they travel somewhere new.

This open-source repo contains a showcase of some the code I used in writing the the Green Book Project's monolithic backend server.


## Architecture

This directory housed the primary server logic behind The Green Book Project. This app was built over the course of a few years, starting out as a simple hobby project before turning into a monothlic service built to serve the varying team needs of the entire Green Book Project backend.

In general you'll find that I started with a simple MVC architectural approach before tacking on various components over the years such as a REST API, an Event-Driven service, and a GraphQL API.
